        The 2023 Awards Booklet, created by the New York District Awards Committee, is now available for review. The Leadership Training Conference will feature awards for both individuals and clubs. Members of all levels, including officers, advisors, and Key Club members, are eligible to apply as long as they meet the necessary criteria. To be considered for the Distinguished Club Award, all D7 clubs must complete and submit the Annual Club Achievement Report Form. While the LTG will be sending out a list of recommended awards to each club's president and advisor, clubs are not limited to these recommendations and are encouraged to consider other awards as well. There has been a delay in sending out the nominations, but they will be sent out as soon as possible. The link to the 2023 Awards Booklet can be found here, at the button below.

        Key Club International (KCI) has released a series of new courses for their Global Leadership Certificate (GLC) program, which is aimed at helping members develop their leadership skills. These new courses provide a fresh perspective for those who have completed previous GLC courses and can be great additions to resumes. The GLC program is designed to help members develop their leadership skills through a series of courses. The courses cover a wide range of topics, including communication, team building, conflict resolution, and project planning. The goal of the GLC program is to provide members with the knowledge and skills they need to become effective leaders within their Key Club and in their communities. Clubs participating in GLC are encouraged to promote it and encourage their members to participate. If you would like more information about GLC, please feel free to contact me or visit the Key Club International website. Alternatively, you can click the button below for more information.

        Along with my own Newsletter, Cindy Zou, the District Bulletin Editor, has created her own Newsletter called The Empire Key. I highly recommend you read The Empire Key in addition to The Seals Post. Cindy has worked extremely hard to make her Newsletter so it would be amazing if you could take the time to read it. It looks incredible while containing additional vital information, so it should be a must-read.
